LeetCode Problem 150: Valid Sudoku
This repository contains a solution for the LeetCode problem 150: Valid Sudoku.

Description:

The code implements a function IsValidSudoku that determines if a given Sudoku board is valid. A valid Sudoku board follows these rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition. Â  
Solution Approach:

This solution utilizes three dictionaries to track used digits in each row, column, and sub-box. It iterates through the board and checks for each filled cell (. represents empty slots):

If the current character exists in the corresponding row, column, or sub-box dictionary, the board is invalid (duplicate digit).
Otherwise, the character is added to the corresponding dictionaries.
Key Points:

The sub-box index is calculated using the formula: $$subsetIndex = (row / 3) * 3 + (col / 3)$$. This maps each sub-box to a unique key in the dictionary.
$$Time Complexity: O(9^2)$$ - The solution iterates through all cells in the 9x9 board.

$$Memory Complexity: O(9^2)$$ - Three dictionaries are used, each with a maximum size of 9 (for digits 1-9).

Code Breakdown:

The provided code implements the solution described above. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

Dictionaries:
sudokuColMap: Tracks used digits in each column.
sudokuRowMap: Tracks used digits in each row.
sudokuSubSetMap: Tracks used digits in each sub-box.
Iteration:
Two nested loops iterate through each cell in the board.
Checking for Duplicates:
If the current character (currentChar) exists in the corresponding dictionary entry, the board is invalid.
Adding Digits:
If the character is unique, it's added to the corresponding dictionaries.
